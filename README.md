# miniester.github.io

This was a project to learn basic html and css.<br/>
It contains some files (e.g. .htacess, xml sitemap),<br/>
that arent necessary/dont work on github pages,<br/>
but are helpful if ever deployed to a dynamic server. <br/>

May be removed later: <br/>
.html in all hrefs of html files <br/>
